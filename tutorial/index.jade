      ## Warm Transfer
      ![Warm Transfer](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/warm-transfers.png)

      Have you ever been disconnected from a support call while being transferred to
      someone else?

      Warm transfer eliminates this problem. Using Twilio powered
      warm transfers your agents will have the ability
      to dial in another agent in real-time.

      Here is how it works at a high level:

      1. The first agent becomes available when he/she connects through the web client.

      1. The second agent also becomes available when he/she connects through the web client.

      1. A client calls our support line.

      1. The client stays on hold while the first agent joins the call.

      1. While the first agent is on the phone with the client, he/she can dial a second agent into the call.

      1. Once the second agent is on the call, the first one can disconnect from it.
      The client and the second agent stay on the call.

      Let's get started!

      ## Setting Up the Voice Webhook

      First let's configure the voice webhook for the Twilio number that customers
      will dial when they want to talk to a support agent.

      ## Connecting an Agent

      Here you can see all front-end code necessary to connect an agent using
      [Twilio's Voice Web Client](//www.twilio.com/webrtc).

      We essentially need three things to have a live web client:
      * A capability token (provided by our app)
      * A unique identifier (string) for each agent
      * Event listeners to handle different Twilio-triggered events

      In the next step we'll take a closer look into capability token
      generation.

      ## Generate a Capability Token

      In order to connect the [Twilio Voice Web Client](//www.twilio.com/webrtc)
      we need a [capability token](//www.twilio.com/docs/client/capability-tokens).

      To allow incoming connections through the web client an identifier must
      be provided when generating the token. For this tutorial we used fixed
      identifier strings like `agent1` and `agent2`, but you can use any
      generated string for your call center clients. These identifiers will be
      used to create outbound calls to the specified agent using the [Twilio
      REST API](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest).

    :markdown
      ## Handling Incoming Calls

      When a client makes a call to our Twilio number the application receives
      a POST request asking for instructions. We'll use [TwiML](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/) to instruct the client
      to join a conference room and the Twilio REST API client to start a call with
      the first agent, so he can join the same conference.

      When providing instructions to the client, we also provide a callback
      [`waitUrl`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/conference#attributes-waitUrl),
      which in our case is another end point of our application. This returns more TwiML
      to [say](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/say) welcome to the user, and also
      [play](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/play) some music while on hold.
      Take a look at the code
      [here](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/warm-transfer-servlets/blob/master/src/main/java/com/twilio/warmtransfer/utils/TwimlBuilder.java#L23)

      We use the client's [`CallSid`](//www.twilio.com/help/faq/voice/what-is-a-call-sid) as the conference identifier. Since all participants
      need this identifier to join the conference, we'll need to store it in a database so that we can grab it when we dial the second agent in later.

    :markdown
      ## Providing TwiML Instruction For The Client

      Here we create a `TwiMLResponse` that will contain a
      [`Dial`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial) verb with a
      [`Conference`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/conference) noun that
      will instruct the client to join a specific conference room.

    data-highlight='26,27,40-49')
    :markdown
      ## Dial First Agent Into the Call

      For our app we created a `callAgent` method to handle dialing our agents. This method uses
      Twilio's REST API to create a new call. The `create` method
      receives a map with the following keys:

      1. `From`: Your Twilio number

      1. `To`  : The agent web client's identifier (`agent1` or `agent2`)

      1. `Url` : A URL to ask for TwiML instructions when the call connects

      Once the agent answers the call in the web client, a request is made to the
      callback URL instructing this call to join the conference room where
      the client is already waiting.

    data-highlight='23-35')
    :markdown
      ## Dial Second Agent Into the Call

      When the client and the first agent are both in the call we are ready to
      perform a *warm  transfer* to a second agent. The first agent makes a
      request and we look for his `conferenceId` needed to dial the second agent in.
      Since we already have a `callAgent` method we can simply call it to connect the second agent in.

  .step(
    data-title='The First Agent Leaves the Call',
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/warmtransfer/utils/TwimlBuilder.java',
    data-highlight='23-25')
    :markdown
      ## The First Agent Leaves the Call

      When the three participants have joined the same call, the first agent has
      served his purpose. Now he can drop the call, leaving agent two and the client
      to have a pleasant conversation.

      It is important to notice the differences between the TwiML each one of the
      participants received when joining the call. Both, agent one and two, have
      `startConferenceOnEnter` set to `true`. This means the conference will start when
      any of them joins the call. For the client calling and for agent two `endConferenceOnExit`
      is set to true. This causes the call to end when either of these two participants
      drops the call.

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We have just implemented warm transfers using Java Servlets.
      Now your clients won't get disconnect from support calls while they are being
      transferred to some else.
